## 📦 What Shipped

> Things that made it out the door, survived review, and are now someone else's problem (in the best way).

| Item | Type | PR / Link | Merged By |
|---|---|---|---|
| Doc agent configuration + quality-gated Episode 002 run | Task | [TASKS/0014](../../../TASKS/0014-doc-agent-step04-configure.md) · PR #8 | `matt@appyhourlabs.com` |
| GitHub tool wiring, Slack routing fix, and `gh` dry-runs | Task | [TASKS/0016](../../../TASKS/0016-doc-agent-github-tool-wiring.md) | `matt@appyhourlabs.com` |

**Highlight of the week:** The Documentary Agent now owns its own GitHub workflow — branches, commits, and PR hand-offs all flow through `doc/` branches without human shell babysitting.

## 🔥 What Broke

> Honest accounting. No euphemisms. "Unexpected behavior" is not a sentence we use here.

| What | When | Duration | Root Cause (short) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Doc agent messages silently routed to `main` agent | 2026-02-21 20:10 ET | ~30 min | Missing Slack binding in `openclaw.json`; fixed during Task 0016 by adding explicit channel rule |

**Breakage score this week:** `2/10`

## 🚨 Incidents

> If it woke someone up or made Slack go red, it lives here.

### Incident Log

| ID | Severity | Summary | Status | Postmortem Link |

**Severity scale reminder:**
- **SEV-1** — Production impact, data at risk, or agent went rogue 🚨
- **SEV-2** — Degraded output quality, policy breach, manual intervention required ⚠️
- **SEV-3** — Noticeable but contained; no user impact 📋

## 🧭 Decisions

> Choices made this week that future-us will have to live with.

| Decision | Rationale | Owner | ADR Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Let the doc agent run `gh` directly for episode PRs | Removes the human bottleneck on branch/PR creation while keeping review gates intact; leverages existing `gh` auth | `matt@appyhourlabs.com` | *TBD* |
| Bake Slack routing bindings into the new-agent checklist | Missing bindings silently hand traffic to `main`; codified in [RUNBOOKS/new-agent-slack-setup.md](../../../RUNBOOKS/new-agent-slack-setup.md) | `matt@appyhourlabs.com` | *TBD* |
| Design the daily cron run as an isolated session with a 120s cap | Keeps the scheduled check-in from inheriting stale context and bounds runaway loops ahead of Task 0017 completion | `doc@appyhourlabs.com` | *TBD* |

## 🛡️ Guardrail Changes

> Any additions, removals, or threshold adjustments to policy gates, allowlists, or denylist rules.

Guardrails held. Good guardrails.

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

> What we now know that we did not know seven days ago. Ideally things we only had to learn once.

1. **Routing rules are not optional.** Without a channel binding, every carefully written system prompt is wasted on the wrong agent.
2. **Tool instructions live in the SOUL or they don't exist.** The GitHub section now spells out branch prefixes, reviewer requirements, and file scope, which kept the first automated PR dry-run on the rails.
3. **Scheduled runs demand smaller batteries.** The cron spec forced us to trim the daily checklist to "scan → assess → report" so a 120-second SLA is realistic.

## 📅 Next Week Plan

> The plan we will look back on with fondness and/or regret.

| Priority | Task | Owner | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Finish Task 0017 — deploy the doc agent on the 09:00 ET cron schedule | `doc@appyhourlabs.com` | Cron job `doc-daily-checkin` live, HEARTBEAT updated, manual test logged |
| P1 | Wire EvalPal quality gates into the doc pipeline | `doc@appyhourlabs.com` | Each draft reports gate scores inline with the Slack summary |
| P2 | Scope social hand-off plan (Task 0015) for post-Phase A sharing | `matt@appyhourlabs.com` | Draft checklist describing draft-to-queue workflow for the doc agent |

**Carry-overs from last week:** Eval gate wiring slipped behind the agent tooling work.

**Veo 3 Prompt:** Office mockumentary style. Extreme close-up macro shot of a computer monitor displaying crisp, legible terminal code as it autonomously opens a GitHub Pull Request. In the slightly out-of-focus foreground, a project manager looks deadpan into the camera lens and sips from a coffee mug. Sharp focus on the screen text.
