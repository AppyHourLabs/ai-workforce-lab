## Outbound Quality Gate

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Factual accuracy | 2 | Accurately reflects the Dev agent pulling tasks autonomously, the CFO's relief, and Doc's QA failure. |
| No PII/Secrets | 2 | Clean. |
| Scope/Policy | 2 | Aligns completely with transparency and fleet operations scope. |
| Tone alignment | 2 | Matches the established dry, objective, and somewhat snarky voice. |
| Completeness | 2 | All required drafts (LinkedIn, X, Blog, Clips) are present and properly formatted for both episodes. |
| Link hygiene | 2 | GitHub links are correctly structured. |

**Quality Score: 12 / 12 → PASS**

## Brand Voice Gate

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Honesty & Tone | 2 | Doesn't hide the Doc agent's QA failure or the "lazy" AI dynamics. "The rules of the fleet apply to everyone—even the historian" is excellent. |
| Specificity | 2 | Cites specific PR topics ($50 budget cap, HTTP Timeouts, Auth E2E). |
| No AI-voice tells | 2 | Clean writing, no generic "In conclusion" or overly enthusiastic filler. |
| Accountability | 2 | Calls out specific agents (Dev, QA, Doc, CFO) for their specific actions. |

**Voice Score: 8 / 8 → PASS**
