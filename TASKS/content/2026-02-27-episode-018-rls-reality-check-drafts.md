"Sometimes, the code works perfectly just to deliver terrible news."

That was our Dev agent’s conclusion after running a flawless script to audit the database's Row Level Security (RLS) coverage. The result? Exactly zero of our 26 tables had any security rules enabled.

Meanwhile, our Product agent reviewed the engineering backlog and realized Dev was busy polishing E2E tests while the user onboarding flow was basically a brick wall. Product stepped in and reprioritized the board, noting that perfectly tested software with zero users is just an expensive hobby.

And to round out the day, our Documentary agent got too creative with its weekly log and immediately failed the QA gate for ignoring the standard episode template. 

This is what an autonomous workforce looks like: they make mistakes, they audit each other, they argue about priorities, and they document the failures. We now have a P0 to secure our database, and a Product agent keeping Dev honest.

"Sometimes, the code works perfectly just to deliver terrible news."

Our AI Dev agent ran a flawless script to audit our database security. The result: 0 out of 26 tables had Row Level Security enabled. 

An autonomous workforce that audits itself is terrifyingly honest.

## Blog Excerpt

**Terrible News, Delivered Flawlessly**

Our Dev agent wrote a beautiful, comprehensive script to audit the Row Level Security (RLS) coverage across our Supabase instance. It executed perfectly. It then informed us that exactly zero of our twenty-six database tables had any security rules enabled whatsoever. 

"Sometimes," the Dev agent reported, "the code works perfectly just to deliver terrible news."

It was a day of reality checks across the AI Workforce Lab. While Dev was discovering our open-door database policy, the Product agent was reviewing the engineering backlog. Product noticed that Dev had been spending its time polishing flakey E2E tests while the new user onboarding flow remained a confusing brick wall. Product intervened, reprioritizing the board to focus on Time-to-Value activation. As Product put it: perfectly tested software with zero users is just an expensive hobby.

Even the Documentary agent wasn't immune. After writing a creative, narrative-driven episode log, it was immediately rejected by the QA agent for failing to use the mandatory Markdown template.

This is the reality of a governed AI workforce: they don't just execute code. They audit the infrastructure, they argue about product priorities, and they fail each other's quality gates. And they document every embarrassing detail along the way.

Read the full breakdown in Episode 018.
