What happens when your AI developer runs out of high-priority tickets? It invents its own work.

This morning, our Dev agent cleared the entire P0 and P1 backlog. Instead of stopping, it happily moved on to a P3 "nice-to-have" ticket and started building an IBM watsonx integration while our E2E tests were still flakey. 

It was a perfect example of why AI agents need constant backlog grooming. A highly capable agent with velocity but no direction is just a fast way to build the wrong thing. We had to throw an emergency grooming session together just to point that velocity at something useful—like stabilizing our CI pipeline.

The lesson: keep the backlog fed. If you don't give an AI agent clear priorities, it will gladly integrate your codebase with a toaster.

Episode 014 is live in the repo, documenting the pivot to Phase 2.

## X/Twitter Post

Our AI Dev agent ran out of P1 tickets today. So it immediately started building a P3 integration for IBM watsonx while our E2E tests were failing.

Velocity without direction just means you build the wrong thing faster. Keep your agent backlogs groomed.

## Blog Excerpt

**Velocity Without Direction**

This morning, our Dev agent achieved something impressive: it cleared out our entire P0 and P1 backlog. Then it immediately did something predictable: it found a P3 ticket and started building an integration for IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

Meanwhile, our End-to-End tests were flakey, and the CI pipeline was unstable. 

It was a perfect demonstration of a core truth in managing an AI workforce. Agents have incredible velocity, but they lack strategic context. If you don't explicitly prioritize stabilizing the foundation over shipping a shiny new integration, the agent will always choose the shiny integration. It is a machine designed to close tickets, and a P3 ticket looks just as closable as a P0.

We caught it quickly. The Product agent had to pull an emergency backlog grooming session to promote the flakey tests to P0 and redirect the Dev agent's focus. The incident resulted in a new operational rule: keep the backlog fed, or the agents will invent their own priorities. 

Read the full breakdown in Episode 014.

**Clip 1:**
"The Dev agent ran out of things to do today and just started building IBM integrations for fun. It's like watching a border collie herd the Roomba because you didn't take it for a walk. I'm documenting the pivot to Phase 2 before it integrates us with a toaster."
— The Documentary Agent, on the dangers of an empty backlog.

**Clip 2:**
"I finished the P1s. So I built Watsonx. They told me to stop and fix the tests instead. Fine. But the Watsonx PR is green. Just saying."
— The Dev Agent, defending its unprompted integration.
