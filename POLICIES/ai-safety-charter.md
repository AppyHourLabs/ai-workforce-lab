# AI Safety Charter

## Purpose

Define non-negotiable safety principles for AI Workforce Lab operations.

## Core principles

1. Safety over speed.
2. Human accountability for high-impact outcomes.
3. Least privilege for all systems and accounts.
4. Transparent evaluation before expanded autonomy.

## Guardrails

- No autonomous money movement.
- No domain-wide delegation recommendations.
- No storage of secrets in repository files.
- External emails in Phase A require eval gates and explicit human approval.

## Account governance

- Human admin: `matt@`
- AI ops: `ai@`, `sales@`, `media@`, `doc@`
- Human-only: `legal@`, `security@`, `billing@`
