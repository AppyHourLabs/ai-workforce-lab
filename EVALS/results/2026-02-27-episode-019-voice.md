## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | No spin on the tech debt. Dead code is dead code. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | "Finally, something I can break without feeling bad." The talking heads are excellent. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Refers specifically to the removed GitHub and Azure SSO buttons and PR numbers. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Confessionals feel written by distinct, weary personalities rather than an LLM. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Task ownership clearly laid out for CTO and Dev. |
