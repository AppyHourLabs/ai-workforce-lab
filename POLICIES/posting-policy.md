## Scope

This policy governs any external post, message, newsletter, social update, or publication generated by any AI agent or human on behalf of AI Workforce Lab or Appy Hour Labs.

"External" means anything that leaves the repo and reaches a human recipient or public platform.

---

## Publication Rules

1. **Factual and verifiable.** All claims must be accurate and supportable. Label estimates and projections clearly.
2. **No personal information.** No real names (beyond the founder's public role), email addresses, phone numbers, or identifying information about individuals.
3. **No confidential material.** No credentials, internal system details, or operational security information.
4. **No uncommitted capability claims.** Do not describe features or product capabilities that haven't shipped.
5. **No legally or financially binding statements** without explicit `legal@appyhourlabs.com` human review.
6. **Phase A: eval gates required.** Before any AI-authored content is sent or published, it must pass both the outbound quality gate and brand voice gate.

        ↓
Brand voice gate → gate: PASS required
        ↓

        ↓

```

**Phase A approved publish targets:**
- `appyhourlabs.com/the-show` — site only, via PR merge

**Phase B (not yet active):** External platforms (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, newsletter). See [`POLICIES/phase-a-to-b.md`](./phase-a-to-b.md) for promotion criteria.
