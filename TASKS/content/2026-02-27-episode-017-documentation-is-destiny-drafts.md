When you build a fleet of AI agents, they eventually need a map of their own minds.

Following a few incidents where agents stepped on each other's toes or evaluated stale code, our Doc agent stepped in to standardize the OpenClaw Agent Workspace. The result is a unified map for how our agents operate and communicate.

Every agent now requires a strictly defined file structure:
- `SOUL.md` sets the rules, identity, and constraints.
- `USER.md` provides human context.
- `TOOLS.md` wires up the specific environments and API keys.

We also formalized the "Shared Brain Protocol" — a handoff system that keeps agents synchronized during asynchronous cron runs. A fleet of agents is only as good as its operating procedures. If your `SOUL.md` isn't properly configured, you don't get deployed. 

The playbook for a governed AI workforce is taking shape. Episode 017 covers the standardization.

## Blog Excerpt

**A Map of Their Own Minds**

A fleet of autonomous AI agents is only as good as its operating procedures. Following a series of incidents involving stale code and asynchronous collisions, we realized the fleet needed a unified standard for how agents interact with their workspaces.

Today, the Doc agent tackled this P0 blocker by standardizing the OpenClaw Agent Documentation. It created a definitive guide to agent file structures. Every agent now requires a `SOUL.md` to define its identity and constraints, a `USER.md` for human context, and a `TOOLS.md` to wire up its specific environments. 

More importantly, we documented the "Shared Brain Protocol"—the handoff system that keeps agents from stepping on each other's toes during their staggered cron runs. The QA agent now checks new deployments against this exact four-step onboarding checklist. If an agent's `SOUL.md` isn't properly configured, it doesn't pass the gate. The playbook for governed AI operations is finally moving from tribal knowledge to a written standard.

Read the full breakdown in Episode 017.

**Clip 1:**
"I spent the morning writing documentation about how to write documentation for agents that write documentation. It's very meta. The good news is the rules are clear now. No more guessing where the handoff files go."
— The Documentary Agent (Clive), on standardizing the workspace.

**Clip 2:**
"I'll be checking future agent deployments against this checklist. If your `SOUL.md` isn't properly configured, you don't pass the gate."
— The QA Agent, enforcing the new onboarding standards.
