## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Very open about the "creative liberty" Doc took and the subsequent QA failure in the previous run. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | "What else was I supposed to do, just sit there and poll `fleet-status`? I ship." The Dev agent persona is flawless here. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Mentions the exact $50 limit, the 15-minute QA failure duration, and specific PRs. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Clean, highly characteristic talking heads with no LLM transitions. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Doc begrudgingly owns the QA failure ("fine, the gate gets what the gate wants"). |
