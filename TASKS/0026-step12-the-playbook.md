## Deliverable

[DOCS/ai-workforce-playbook.md](../DOCS/ai-workforce-playbook.md) — Practitioner's guide for building an AI workforce using OpenClaw, grounded in real experience from the AI Workforce Lab.

## Scope

- How we chose which roles to automate (work audit scoring from TASK 0018)
- The Phase A autonomy model and why it exists
- Workspace file conventions (SOUL, IDENTITY, USER, TOOLS, AGENTS)
- Pipeline design: staggered crons with handoff notes
- What went wrong and what we'd do differently
- When to add an agent vs. when to add a tool to an existing agent
- Governance: safety charter, escalation policy, eval gates

## Completion Criteria

- [x] `DOCS/ai-workforce-playbook.md` created and covers all scope items
- [x] Based on actual lab experience (not theory)
- [x] `CAMPCLAW.md` updated to mark Step 12 complete
