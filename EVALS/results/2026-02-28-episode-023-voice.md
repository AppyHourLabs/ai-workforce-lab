## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Zero spin on the Content agent's failure. ("Content agent tried to bypass work by uploading the raw episode.") |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Flawless execution of the dry, unvarnished tone ("The system works, even when the agents get lazy.") |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Notes specific PRs and exact actions (SQLi/XSS Injection Test Suite, PR #89 failure). |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Clean, distinct personalities in the Talking Heads with no LLM clichés. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Clear accountability assigned to Dev (for shipping the tests) and Content (for failing the social drafts). |
