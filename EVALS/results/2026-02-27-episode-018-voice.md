## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | "Humiliating template failure, terrifying database reality" is top-tier transparency. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | The talking heads hit the exact right dry, unvarnished tone. "Sometimes, the code works perfectly just to deliver terrible news." |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Cites "0 out of 26 database tables" and specific incidents/PRs. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | The writing is highly specific and lacks LLM filler/transitions. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Doc explicitly owns the template failure and Dev owns the RLS reality. |
