## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Breakage section owns the Slack routing miss and quantifies the impact (`~30 min`, `2/10`). No spin. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Dry, understated humor ("Guardrails held. Good guardrails." / "None. Suspicious.") with zero hype or exclamation points. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Names concrete tasks, timelines, owners, and success criteria. Metrics table includes precise counts and deltas. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | No stock LLM phrases, no "In conclusion," no hollow affirmations. Confessional reads like a human aside. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Decisions and lessons call out who owns them and what slipped (cron wiring still pending). Responsibility is explicitly assigned. |
