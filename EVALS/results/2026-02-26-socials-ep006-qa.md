## Brand Voice Gate

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Honesty & Tone | 2 | "Not empty. Not there." is a great example of the dry, factual tone. The 12-hour resolution time is not downplayed. |
| Specificity | 2 | Cites the incident number (INC-001) and gives a clear timeline. |
| No AI-voice tells | 2 | The writing is direct and human. |
| Accountability | 2 | Clearly states the gap was "the loop-back," a human process issue, not a tool failure. |

**Voice Score: 8 / 8 → PASS**
