## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Straightforward tracking of the budget increase and telemetry landing. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Appropriately dry. "It's funny how a spreadsheet update changes the entire tone of the office" fits the brand voice. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Cites the exact budget limit ($50), specific tasks (`TASKS/finance/budget-tracker.md`), and PR numbers. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Clean, human-like writing. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Accurately assigns ownership of milestones (Matt for budget, CTO for telemetry, Dev for CLI module). |
