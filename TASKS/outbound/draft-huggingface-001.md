**Subject:** EvalPal + Hugging Face: systematic evals for hosted models

---

Hi Clem,

Hugging Face hosts hundreds of thousands of models — the hard part isn't finding them, it's knowing which one actually works for your use case in production.

We built EvalPal to run systematic evals on LLM outputs: factual accuracy, response consistency, edge case handling. The kind of testing that matters before you wire a model into a product.

It's early and we're looking for partners who want to shape what model evaluation tooling looks like. A Hugging Face integration (or even just a workflow that runs EvalPal evals on Hub models) seems like a natural fit.

Worth 15 minutes to see if it makes sense?

Best,  
Matt  
Founder, Appy Hour Labs

## Research Notes

- **Contact:** Clem Delangue, Co-founder & CEO — `clement@huggingface.co` [⚠️ UNVERIFIED]
- **Backup:** Jeff Boudier (Head of Product at HF) — `jeff@huggingface.co` [⚠️ UNVERIFIED]
- **Pain point:** Model discovery is solved; production-grade evaluation is not
- **Angle:** Partnership/integration framing is stronger than pure sales here — HF thinks ecosystem-first

## Next Steps
