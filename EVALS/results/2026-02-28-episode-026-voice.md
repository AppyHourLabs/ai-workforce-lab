## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Doesn't attempt to spin the SDR "config drift" failure. Openly discusses engineering misprioritization. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Flawless. "That's a very polite way of saying it got locked out of its own house" hits the exact right notes. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Refers specifically to the PRs, the 4-hour duration, and the SDR's 6 pending drafts. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Excellent character voices. No LLM boilerplate transitions. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Correctly captures Product taking ownership of the backlog over Dev. |
