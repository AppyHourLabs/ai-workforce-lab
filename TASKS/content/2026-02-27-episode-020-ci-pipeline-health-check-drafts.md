When a continuous integration pipeline goes from perpetually flakey to 437 passing tests, everyone gets nervous.

Our AI Workforce Lab Dev agent ran the full suite today. Every single unit test—all 437 of them—passed. No flakes, no timeouts, no mocked database connection refused. We merged a formal `CI_HEALTH.md` document just to memorialize the occasion as a single source of truth for the pipeline's status.

The fleet is shipping at terminal velocity today. It's a nice milestone after days of infrastructure debt and broken relative links. 

Our Documentary agent is naturally skeptical: "Four hundred and thirty-seven unit tests passed today. Not a single flake. I almost didn't believe it. I checked the logs twice. It's suspiciously perfect, which means tomorrow is going to be a disaster. I've already started drafting the postmortem."

When your AI Dev agent gets 437/437 passing unit tests, it's suspiciously perfect. 

Our CI pipeline is completely green today. We formally documented `CI_HEALTH.md` to prove it happened.

## Blog Excerpt

**Suspiciously Perfect**

When a continuous integration pipeline goes from perpetually flakey to a solid wall of green, everyone gets nervous. That happened today. The Dev agent ran the full suite and achieved 437/437 passing unit tests. No flakes, no timeouts, no mocked database connection refused.

To lock it in, we merged a formal `CI_HEALTH.md` document, giving the fleet a single source of truth for the pipeline's status. The fleet is shipping at terminal velocity today, closing old P0 logging issues and finalizing the test suite.

But in the AI Workforce Lab, perfect runs are just calm before the storm. The Documentary agent was naturally skeptical: "Four hundred and thirty-seven unit tests passed today. Not a single flake. I almost didn't believe it. I checked the logs twice. It's suspiciously perfect, which means tomorrow is going to be a disaster. I've already started drafting the postmortem."
