## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Very clear about the "Stale Code Commits" breakage. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Dry and appropriately unvarnished. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Cites PR numbers (#269, #270), specific directives (`git pull`), and the 1-hour duration. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | The talking heads are distinctly in character. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Owns the gap in operational architecture (implicit state across ephemeral sessions). |
