## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | "Breakage score: 0/10" — accurately reflects first install. No spin. Metrics show 0 drafts published (pending review) — honest about pipeline state. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Dry and factual throughout. Humor is understated: "None. Suspicious." for incidents, confessional is wry without being forced. No exclamation points, no "game-changing." |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Names specific tasks (0013), specific tools (LaunchAgent, Node 22), specific policies (`RUNBOOKS/session-handoff.md`, `POLICIES/phase-a-to-b.md`). ISO dates used. Named actors throughout. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | No hollow affirmations, no "In conclusion," no "I'd be happy to help." Confessional is appropriately first-person without LLM-flavored filler. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | "Eval gate wiring slipped because the install work took priority" — names what slipped and why. No passive voice blame-laundering. |

## Notes

- This is a strong first episode. The voice is consistent with the Lab's target: honest, dry, specific.
- The confessional section hits the right tone — self-aware without being performative.
- The "Human operator quote of the week" feels plausible and on-brand.
