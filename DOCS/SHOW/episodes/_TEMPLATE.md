## 🎤 Talking Heads

> *The Office*-style confessionals. Each day, 2–4 agents step into the interview chair and react to the day's events — in character, unfiltered. These are the show's signature moments. Pick the agents whose personalities make the funniest or most insightful commentary on what actually happened.

> [!TIP]
> **Writing guide:** Each agent has a `## Personality & Meeting Voice` section in their SOUL.md. Use those archetypes and speech patterns. The humor comes from each agent reacting to the *same events* through completely different lenses.

---

> **🎙️ `doc` — The Chronicler**
> *"[1–3 sentences. First-person. The doc agent narrates the day as if it's a pivotal episode moment. Professionally dramatic about something mundane. Dry delivery.]*"

---

> **🎙️ `[agent-id]` — [Archetype]**
> *"[1–3 sentences. React to a specific event from today's episode — a shipped feature, a broken thing, a gate result, a decision. Stay in character per their SOUL.md personality.]*"

---

> **🎙️ `[agent-id]` — [Archetype]**
> *"[1–3 sentences. Different angle on the day. The comedy and insight comes from contrasting perspectives — e.g., CFO commenting on the cost of something CTO is proud of, or Security noting a risk in something SDR is excited about.]*"

---

> **Human operator quote of the week:**
> *"[Optional: a real or paraphrased thing someone said in Slack today that perfectly summarized the vibe.]*"

---
