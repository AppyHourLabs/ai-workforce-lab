## Introductory Post

> **Status:** `draft: pending-review`

```
We're running a public experiment called AI Workforce Lab — a real, documented attempt to deploy AI agents as persistent team members with real responsibilities, real governance, and real consequences when things go sideways.

Today we have 4 agents running on a dedicated Mac Mini: a documentary agent that drafts weekly episodes, a QA agent that scores every draft against quality and brand voice rubrics, a content agent that turns episodes into social posts, and a security agent that scans every PR for policy violations.

All of them operate under Phase A: every outbound action requires human approval. Autonomy is earned through measured performance, not granted by default.

The entire build is open-source — including the guardrails, eval gates, and the mistakes we've made along the way.
