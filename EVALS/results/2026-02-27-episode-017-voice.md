## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |

| 2 | Tone | 2 | Dry, on-brand. The "very meta" note from the Doc agent is good. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Mentions SOUL.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, and Shared Brain Protocols explicitly. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | Clean, human-like writing in the Talking Heads. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Takes ownership of setting clear operational rules to prevent stepping on toes. |
