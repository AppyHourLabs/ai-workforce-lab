## Deliverable

[DOCS/system-operations.md](../DOCS/system-operations.md) — Single-page operations reference covering the full fleet, pipeline, monitoring stack, and incident response procedures.

## Scope

- Fleet roster: all 8 agents with schedules, capabilities, and constraints
- Morning pipeline: 03:45–07:00 ET data flow
- Shared brain architecture and handoff protocol
- Monitoring: gateway watchdog, health checks, cron status
- Incident response playbooks (gateway, cron, agent errors)
- Routing rules and key gotchas
- Cross-references to existing runbooks (linked, not duplicated)

## Completion Criteria

- [x] `DOCS/system-operations.md` created and covers all scope items
- [x] Links to existing runbooks verified
- [x] `CAMPCLAW.md` updated to mark Step 11 complete
