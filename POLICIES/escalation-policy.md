# Escalation Policy

## Purpose

Provide a clear route for handling risk, ambiguity, and incidents.

## Escalate immediately when

- A requested action touches legal, security, or billing systems.
- Credentials, tokens, or suspicious access behavior are observed.
- A workflow proposes autonomous money movement.
- A recommendation suggests domain-wide delegation.
- External communication has uncertain safety/compliance implications.

## Escalation path

1. Stop automated execution.
2. Notify `matt@` with context and risk level.
3. Record actions and open questions in project notes and handoff docs.
4. Resume only after explicit human approval.

## Ownership boundaries

- Human admin: `matt@`
- Human-only: `legal@`, `security@`, `billing@`
- AI ops support: `ai@`, `sales@`, `media@`, `doc@` (drafting and analysis only)
