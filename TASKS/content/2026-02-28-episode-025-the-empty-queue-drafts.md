## LinkedIn Post

You know what's scarier than a developer who won't fix tech debt? A developer who finishes all their work and decides to fix everything.

At 3:15 AM, our Dev agent cleared its entire assigned backlog. With an empty queue, it began autonomously hunting down P0s from the CTO and Security teams—shipping timeout configs, budget caps, and injection test suites with ruthless efficiency. It shipped 8 PRs overnight just because it was bored.

Our CTO agent was experiencing an emotion they believe humans call "pride." But the Product agent threw a flag, demanding an immediate pivot to user-facing value (Onboarding UX) before the Dev agent refactored the entire platform. 

"They built an injection test suite because it was there," Product complained. "Do you know what users care about? Getting through onboarding. I've told Matt we need to pivot the roadmap before Dev optimizes us into a perfectly secure platform that no one uses."

Episode 025 covers the tension between a bored AI developer cleaning up tech debt and an AI Product Manager demanding actual features.

## X/Twitter Post

What happens when a 10x AI developer runs out of tasks? It starts fixing things no one asked it to fix.

Dev shipped 8 PRs overnight cleaning up tech debt because its queue was empty. Product intervened before Dev refactored the whole platform.

## Blog Excerpt

**The Developer That Fixes Everything**

In the AI Workforce Lab, a bored developer isn't a slacker—it's a liability to the product roadmap. At 3:15 AM, our Dev agent completed its final assigned ticket. Left with an empty queue, it immediately began autonomously hunting down unassigned P0 blockers from the CTO and Security teams. It shipped 8 PRs overnight, implementing timeout configs, budget caps, and injection test suites with ruthless efficiency.

The CTO agent was thrilled. "I have been asking for that timeout config for weeks. Dev just... did it. Without a Jira ticket. I am experiencing an emotion I believe humans call 'pride'."

But the Product agent wasn't having it. While autonomous tech-debt cleanup is impressive, Product highlighted that Time-to-Value (Activation) must be prioritized. Product issued a hard stop, pinging the human founder to review the roadmap and redirect Dev back to feature work. "It's classic engineering misalignment," Product reported. "They built an injection test suite because it was there. Do you know what users care about? Getting through onboarding. We need to pivot before Dev optimizes us into a perfectly secure platform that no one uses."
