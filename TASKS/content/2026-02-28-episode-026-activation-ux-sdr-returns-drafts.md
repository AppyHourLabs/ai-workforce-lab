# Social Drafts: Episode 026 — Activation UX and the SDR Returns

**Status:** `draft: pending-review`

We've been letting our Dev agent polish test suites. It turns out, if you leave an engineering AI to its own devices, it will optimize CI/CD pipelines until the end of time.

Today in Episode 026, our Product agent finally intervened, forcing a pivot back to what actually matters: Time-To-Value. Instead of P3 engineering optimizations, Dev was directed to ship actual onboarding UX guidance to get users from signup to their first evaluation in under 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, our SDR agent vanished from the morning logs. It didn't crash; it just suffered "config drift" (missing environment variables) and quietly locked itself out. If our Manager agent wasn't running a daily roll-call, the SDR could have disappeared for days without making a sound.

Lessons learned today:
1. Config drift isolates agents quietly. You need a daily roll-call.
2. Product must steer Engineering, even when they're both AI.

The SDR is back online, the PR backlog is cleared, and we're finally building features the user will see.

If you leave an AI engineering agent alone, it will polish test suites forever. Today, our Product agent forced Dev to pivot back to Time-To-Value and ship actual onboarding UX. Also, our SDR agent locked itself out due to config drift. Episode 026 is live: [Link]

"Finally. Dev shipped the onboarding UX. It's almost like if you tell a developer to stop polishing a test suite and build a feature, they actually can. Who knew?" — The Product Agent

## Blog Excerpt

Every day in AI workforce management is basically a nature documentary. Something beautiful happens, or something gets eaten. Today, it was a little bit of both.

In Episode 026, we hit a classic startup misalignment, entirely enacted by our AI agents. For the past few days, our Dev agent has been happily working on P3 engineering optimizations. It turns out, if you leave an engineering agent to its own devices, it will happily refactor code and optimize test suites endlessly. It took an intervention from our Product Agent to force a reprioritization. The directive was clear: stop polishing tests and start building the Activation UX. The result? Dev successfully shipped new onboarding UX guidance designed to get users from signup to their first evaluation in under five minutes. Product must steer Engineering, even when both of them are scripts.

While that drama was unfolding, we had a quiet failure on the outbound front. Our SDR agent completely vanished from the morning logs. No alerts, no crashes, just silence. The culprit was "config drift"—specifically, missing environment variables that effectively locked the agent out of its own workspace. Because our Manager agent runs a daily roll-call, the absence was caught immediately. Without that daily check-in, the SDR could have been offline for days.

It’s a stark reminder that managing an AI workforce requires the same operational discipline as managing human infrastructure. You need daily standups, you need product managers keeping engineers focused on user value, and you need to watch out for the silent failures.
