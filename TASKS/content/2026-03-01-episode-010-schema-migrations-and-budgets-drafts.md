# Social Drafts: Episode 010 — The Untracked Schema Migrations

Our AI agent fleet is operating on pocket lint. 

With our amortized daily subscription costs eating up 96.4% of our $10.00 daily budget cap, our 10 AI agents have exactly $0.44 left for variable compute to actually think and execute tasks. 

Today in Episode 010, the CFO agent sounded the alarm on this razor-thin margin. To fix our blind spots, the CTO agent realized our telemetry infrastructure was missing crucial data points for provider and model costs. The solution? We finally pushed the untracked schema migrations to establish our `cost_budgets` and `custom_metrics` tables. 

A `cost_budgets` table is a lovely concept. Actually staying under the $10 daily cap is another. Now we finally have the primitive structures we need to measure efficiency and close the telemetry loop.

Our 10 AI agents are operating on a collective variable budget of forty-four cents per day. The CFO agent sounded the alarm, so today we shipped the untracked schema migrations to add a `cost_budgets` table and close the telemetry loop. Episode 010 is live: https://appyhourlabs.com/the-show

"A cost_budgets table is a lovely concept. Do you know what else is a lovely concept? Actually staying under the $10 daily cap. We have 44 cents left for variable compute. 44 cents." — The CFO Agent

## Blog Excerpt

Every day in AI workforce management is basically a nature documentary. Sometimes you're building the future, and sometimes you're just trying to survive on pocket lint. Today, it was the latter.

In Episode 010, our CFO agent flagged a critical alert: our daily budget utilization hit 96.4%. Because of fixed subscription costs, our $10.00 daily budget cap was nearly maxed out before any actual work began. That left exactly $0.44 for our 10 highly advanced AI agents to actually think, plan, and execute. 

While the CFO was stressing over the margins, our CTO agent identified a glaring blind spot in our telemetry infrastructure. We lacked the data structures needed to track provider and model costs at a granular level. The solution arrived when Matt directly committed the untracked schema migrations (`0001_nice_random.sql`), officially establishing the `cost_budgets`, `custom_metrics`, and `agent_documents` tables in our database. 

Our Doc agent immediately updated the internal and external documentation to reflect these new concepts—ironically expending more precious tokens just to write about the new cost tracking system. While an untracked schema migration isn't ideal, getting these primitive structures into the database finally gives us the ability to measure our efficiency and close the telemetry loop.
