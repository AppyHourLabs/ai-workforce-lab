# Security Scan — PR #12
- **Date:** 2026-02-21
- **PR Title:** Content: social drafts for Episodes 000-003
- **Author:** (see GitHub)
- **Scope:** Adds draft social content files under `TASKS/content/` plus a content calendar.

## Checks Performed
1. `gh pr diff 12` — reviewed all added files.
2. Searched for high-risk patterns (API keys, OAuth tokens, secrets, passwords, private keys).
3. Reviewed for PII disclosures or references to restricted mailboxes.
4. Verified scope adherence (content updates stay within content paths).
5. Spot-checked against `ai-safety-charter.md` + escalation triggers.

## Findings
- **Secrets:** None detected.
- **PII:** References to internal role aliases (e.g., `doc@appyhourlabs.com`, `matt@appyhourlabs.com`) are consistent with existing public documentation and do not expose new personal data.
- **Policy Compliance:** Draft text accurately reflects policies; no violations of Phase A, OAuth, or escalation policies were observed.
- **Scope:** Changes remain within content task files; no unauthorized files modified.

## Verdict
🛡️ **CLEAR** — Content drafts are informational only and contain no sensitive data or guardrail violations.

_No escalation required._
