## Style Reference

The Day 1 post (`2026-02-23-linkedin-standalone-day1-ai-office.md`) is the canonical example of the narrative standalone post style. See `RUNBOOKS/linkedin-content-strategy.md` → **Narrative Style** section for the full pattern.

**Structure in brief:**
1. Open in the moment — specific action or discovery, not a thesis
2. Walk the sequence — what happened, mechanically and in order
3. Name what was surprising
4. One clean takeaway, stated plainly
5. Close flat — where things stand now, no rallying cry
