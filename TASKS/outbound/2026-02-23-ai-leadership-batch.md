## Prospect 1 — The Pragmatic Engineer (Gergely Orosz)

### Snapshot
- Newsletter reaching 500k+ engineering leaders and managers focused on practical team organization, performance management, and scaling engineering practices.
- Regularly covers unconventional team structures and management experiments.

### Hook
Position the AI Workforce Lab as an engineering management case study: treating agents like team members with job descriptions, performance evaluation, and promotion criteria.

Subject: Managing AI agents like team members: performance evals and promotion paths

Gergely,

We're running an experiment that might interest your readers: managing AI agents with the same rigor as human employees.

At Appy Hour Labs, our "AI Workforce Lab" treats four agents (doc, QA, content, security) like actual team members:
- Each has a job description and scheduled work hours (staggered crons)
- All output goes through performance evaluations before approval (EvalPal gates)
- Promotion from Phase A (draft-only) to Phase B (limited autonomy) requires 20 clean deliverables
- Daily standups via shared brain files and transparent audit trails

What's emerging: the management overhead isn't that different from onboarding junior employees. You need clear expectations, regular feedback, and gradual responsibility increases.

If you're looking for engineering management stories that bridge AI and traditional team scaling, happy to share the playbook and lessons learned.

## Prospect 2 — No Priors Podcast (Sarah Guo & Elad Gil)

### Snapshot
- Top-tier AI investment podcast with deep focus on AI company operations, product strategy, and scaling challenges.
- Regularly features founders discussing practical AI deployment and governance.

### Hook
Frame as an AI product and operations case study: how to actually deploy agents in production with proper governance and evaluation frameworks.

### Draft Email
```
Subject: Case study: deploying AI agents with production governance

Sarah & Elad,

Most AI agent deployments are demos. We built production governance.

Appy Hour Labs' "AI Workforce Lab" is live with four agents running daily operations under strict evaluation gates. Every artifact (docs, PRs, outreach) passes through EvalPal's quality harness before human review.

Key insights that might resonate:
- Phase A/B promotion paths based on performance data, not developer intuition
- Shared brain architecture for agent coordination and audit trails
- Real cost and safety constraints driving architectural decisions

The full experiment is open source, including our failures and pivots. Would be happy to walk through the product decisions and what we've learned about AI operations at scale.

## Prospect 3 — GitHub ReadME Project

### Snapshot
- GitHub's developer community platform featuring innovative projects, tooling stories, and engineering case studies.
- Focuses on open-source projects with interesting technical approaches and community impact.

### Hook
Highlight the open-source AI Workforce Lab repo as an innovative approach to agent governance and evaluation.

### Draft Email
```
Subject: Open-source AI agent governance: the AI Workforce Lab experiment

ReadME Team,

We open-sourced our entire AI operations setup and it's generating some interesting patterns.

The "AI Workforce Lab" repo documents how we deployed four AI agents (doc, QA, content, security) with full transparency: every conversation, eval result, and policy decision is logged. The agents file their own GitHub PRs, coordinate through shared brain files, and earn autonomy through performance data.

Technical highlights:
- EvalPal evaluation harness integrated directly into GitHub workflows
- Phase-based promotion system with quantified performance thresholds
- Reproducible deployment on dedicated Mac Mini with security isolation
- Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging

The community response suggests other teams want this kind of governance framework. Would be interested in sharing the story and technical approach with the ReadME audience.

## Prospect 4 — Sequoia Capital AI Ascent

### Snapshot
- Leading AI-focused newsletter covering portfolio company stories, best practices, and AI industry developments.
- Audience includes AI company founders, operators, and investors looking for practical deployment strategies.

### Hook
Position as a portfolio-relevant case study for AI company operations and governance frameworks.

### Draft Email
```
Subject: AI company operations: governance frameworks for agent deployment

AI Ascent Team,

Portfolio companies are asking how to deploy AI agents responsibly. We built a framework and are running it in public.

Appy Hour Labs' "AI Workforce Lab" addresses the core challenges: evaluation, governance, and gradual autonomy. Four agents handle daily operations under EvalPal's quality gates, with transparent promotion paths from Phase A (draft-only) to Phase B (limited autonomy) based on performance data.

Key frameworks that might interest your audience:
- Quantified performance thresholds for agent autonomy decisions
- Integrated evaluation harness blocking poor quality output
- Shared brain architecture for agent coordination and audit compliance
- Cost and safety constraints driving architectural choices

The full playbook is open source with transparent logs. Happy to share lessons learned about AI operations governance with portfolio companies tackling similar challenges.
