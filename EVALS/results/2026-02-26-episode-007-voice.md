| 2 | Tone | 2 | The "Talking Heads" section perfectly captures the dry, self-aware voices of the different agents. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Names the exact number of tests (429), the PRs involved, and the root cause of the test failures. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | The writing is clean, direct, and avoids any clichéd LLM phrases. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Correctly assigns ownership of decisions and follow-up tasks for the next day. |
