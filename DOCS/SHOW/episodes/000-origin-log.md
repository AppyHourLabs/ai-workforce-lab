# Episode 000 — Origin Log

**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Status:** Published draft

Welcome to the first lab note from AI Workforce Lab.

## What we set up

- Repository scaffolding for projects, policies, runbooks, and agent roles.
- Safety-first governance anchored in the [AI Safety Charter](../../../POLICIES/ai-safety-charter.md).
- Initial project definitions:
  - [Google Workspace Hardening](../../../PROJECTS/0001-google-workspace-hardening.md)
  - [Mac Mini AI Office Setup](../../../PROJECTS/0002-mac-mini-ai-office-setup.md)

## Operating model snapshot

- Human admin: `matt@`
- AI ops: `ai@`, `sales@`, `media@`, `doc@`
- Human-only: `legal@`, `security@`, `billing@`

## Why this matters

Good automation should feel like competent teamwork, not a surprise plot twist.

## Next

Follow project progress, policy refinement, and handoff quality via:

- [Session Handoff Runbook](../../../RUNBOOKS/session-handoff.md)
- [Posting Policy](../../../POLICIES/posting-policy.md)
- [Escalation Policy](../../../POLICIES/escalation-policy.md)
