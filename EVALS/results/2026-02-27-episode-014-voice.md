## Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2/2 | Very transparent about Dev building the wrong priority task because the backlog was empty. |
| 2 | Tone | 2/2 | Dry, understated humor ("border collie herd the Roomba") is a perfect match. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2/2 | Concrete details: IBM watsonx, $50 budget cap. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2/2 | No classic "I hope this finds you" or generic hype. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2/2 | The root cause "Lack of groomed Phase 2 backlog" clearly assigns responsibility to product planning instead of externalizing it. |

**Total Score:** 10/10
**Status:** PASS
