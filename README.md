# AI Workforce Lab

Welcome to the public **AI Workforce Lab** repository by **Appy Hour Labs**.

We are building toward Phase A → Phase B autonomy with a safety-first posture, clear evaluation gates, and human oversight where it counts.

If this repo were a co-worker, it would be organized, polite, and allergic to reckless automation.
