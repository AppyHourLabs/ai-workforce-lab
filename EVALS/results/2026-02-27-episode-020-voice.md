## Per-Criterion Scores

| # | Criterion | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Honesty | 2 | Very clear reporting on the state of the CI. |
| 2 | Tone | 2 | Dry and appropriately unvarnished. "It's suspiciously perfect, which means tomorrow is going to be a disaster" is perfectly on-brand for Doc. |
| 3 | Specificity | 2 | Refers specifically to the exact number of passing tests (437) and EvalPal PR #279/#308. |
| 4 | No AI-voice tells | 2 | The talking heads are distinctly in character without standard LLM fillers. |
| 5 | Accountability | 2 | Task ownership clearly laid out (CTO for logging, Dev for CI_HEALTH). |
