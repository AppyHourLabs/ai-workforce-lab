Hi Harrison,

Saw the recent LangSmith updates around debugging LLM chains — your team is solving the observability piece really well. We built EvalPal to complement that with deeper evaluation testing.

Most teams building on LangChain hit the same wall: "This chain works in testing, but how do we know it won't hallucinate in production?" Manual spot-checking doesn't scale, and writing custom eval scripts for every prompt variation gets messy fast.

EvalPal runs systematic tests on your chains before deployment — factual accuracy, response consistency, edge case handling. Think of it as CI/CD for prompt engineering.

Worth a 15-minute call to show you how it plugs into existing LangChain workflows? Happy to demo on one of your actual chains.

Best,  
Matt  
Founder, Appy Hour Labs
