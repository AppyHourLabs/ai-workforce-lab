# AI Workforce Lab

> **By Appy Hour Labs** · Public experiment in responsible AI deployment · Powered by **EvalPal**

What does it actually look like to deploy AI agents as persistent team members — with real governance, real failure modes, and a public paper trail of what happened?

That's what this repository answers. In real time. With the receipts committed.

## What We're Building

**EvalPal** is the product: tooling and methodology for evaluating AI agent quality in production workflows. The AI Workforce Lab is EvalPal's first test environment — we're building the eval harness by being the thing it evaluates.

**The experiment:** deploy AI agents into operational roles (documentation, QA, content, security, financial analysis, technical strategy, sales outreach, development, product) using a tiered autonomy model. Document everything. Ship the governance alongside the features.

**Current fleet:** 10 agents running on staggered daily cron schedules (03:45–08:00 ET), coordinated by a manager agent with shared brain memory.

**The constraint:** safety first. Always. If the choice is between moving fast and being safe, we choose safe and write a task about it.

## The Autonomy Model

| Phase | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Phase A** (current) | All outbound actions require human approval. Eval gates run before content approaches external recipients. Agents draft, analyze, propose — they do not send or publish autonomously. |
| **Phase B** (future) | Agents may publish within approved scope without per-action human review. Requires measurable evidence from Phase A. Criteria: [`POLICIES/phase-a-to-b.md`](POLICIES/phase-a-to-b.md) |

## Safety

This project operates under a formal safety charter. The short version:

- No agent acts autonomously on external communications in Phase A
- No secrets, credentials, or PII in this repository — ever
- All agent scope changes require human sign-off
- Every incident gets logged; nothing gets quietly swept
